#GUI:
DBG - just for testing
Free Cam - allows user to freely move around the scene using WASD, arrow keys, and some other inputs (detailed upon pressing)
Path Cam - moves camera along path by loading PPC objects from text file "camPaths.txt" 

##Extra:
non-linear interpolation - my camera interp function can take in an arbitrary easing function, as listed in easing.h
