#GUI:
DBG - just for testing
Free Cam - allows user to freely move around the scene using WASD, arrow keys, and some other inputs (detailed upon pressing)
Light Control - allows user to move point light around scene using IJKL keys for lateral movement and U/P for up and down

SM1, SM2, SM3 - Switches scene between lighting modes
SM2 & SM3 - Uses multiple light sources and lighting modes to showcase both SM2 and SM3 side by side
Cycle Lighting Modes - Currently only supports Point lighting and Directional lighting. acts as a toggle between the two for now

##Extra:
Multiple Lights
Directional Lighting
Distance Attenuation for point lighting (i couldn't tell is this counted as extra or not from posts in Piazza, i did it anyway)
